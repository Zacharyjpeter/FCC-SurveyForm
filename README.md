A form for getting user feedback. The most freeform project I've done so far.
<br>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
My biggest challenge was getting the CSS styling just right. The background photo and radio/checkboxes required skills I didn't have yet. Research and asking for help were key.
<br>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
I'm most proud of the form layout and background photo CSS. They were the most difficult to manipulate. Now they almost look like a professional website. They were my favorite parts to tweak. Something I would do different next time is spend more time on details. For example, I don't like the header font and the select box looks weird on mobile. Since the project is "good enough" I'm moving on to the next challenge.
